My project is a demo of the web application security skills that I have learned this year. It features videos that utilize SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc. No software must be installed prior to execution, as the demo is merely videos. However, when I made the videos, I needed to use online platforms such as MDSec Labs and HackThisSite. Both platforms are ones that hackers use to practice and expand their skills without violating any laws or regulations regarding cyber safety. I’m happy to say that thanks to my amazing mentor, Jessica, and this incredible program, I’ve grown so much in my passion and knowledge for cyber defense and would definitely consider it as a future career path.
